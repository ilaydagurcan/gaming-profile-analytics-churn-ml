# Gaming Profile Analytics & Churn Modeling

An end-to-end **gaming analytics and churn prediction** project that combines
**business intelligence dashboards** with **machine learning models** to analyze
player behavior, game economics, and churn risk across platforms.

---

## 1. Project Overview

This project analyzes large-scale gaming data to answer four core business questions:

1. How do player behaviors differ across platforms and genres?
2. Which player segments drive engagement and revenue?
3. What signals indicate early churn risk?
4. Can churn be predicted reliably using behavioral features?

The project integrates **Looker Studio dashboards** for business insights
and **machine learning models** for predictive analytics.

- Game prices and genres
